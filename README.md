# Advanced epidemiology course

The course will take place at 2.00-4.00 p.m. on Tuesday afternoons in the 2nd semester.
It will take place in Lecture Room 2 in Lilybank Gardens (lecture room is in House 2, enter building through House 1).

# Course outline

## AIMS
This course will introduce students to more complex epidemiological concepts and advanced methods employed in modern epidemiological research.

## LEARNING OUTCOMES
Following successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

1.	Both critique and design epidemiological research informed by an understanding of counterfactual thinking and causal diagrams, including a critical understanding of the limits of these approaches.
2.	Recognise important biases and understand how these affect interpretation of findings, understand how such biases can be dealt with through study design and/or statistical analysis and have a critical understanding of the relative strengths and limitations of different methodological approaches.
3.	Critically understand how quantitative methods can be used to apply effect measures to target populations, as well as the assumptions such approaches require.
4.	Critically understand the major methodological issues in natural experiment studies, administrative data analyses and life-course epidemiology and relate these to major theories across the wider field (i.e. collider bias, confounding etc).

## COURSE CONTENT
Eleven sessions. The first ten will comprise a lecture and tutorial this will be followed by a revision session.

## TEACHING METHODS
Lectures and tutorials with some web-based interactive tools.

## ASSESSMENT METHOD
See the Assignment folder above for details.
